## BADFET
BADFET is a soon-to-be open-source EMFI Research Platform. Due to safety
concerns it is currently available to a private audience at
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/RedBalloonShenanigans/BADFET). If you would like
access to this repo please reach out to us at badfet@redballoonsecurity.com.

In this repository you will find our slides from RECON as well as the sample
probe profiles from our slides.
